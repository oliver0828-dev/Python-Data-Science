# Python Data Science & Machine Learning Course 
## Purpose:
As I am currently willing to learn Data Science after my expreience with R in [Stanford Pre-Collegiate Course](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-geun-hyung-park-2b4129319/details/education/). 

### Materials: 
All these course materials are from [Udemy course from Pierian Data](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING), and I wanted share some of my solutions and key notes.
